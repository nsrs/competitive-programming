This is just a handful of some problems I solved back in 2019 (and january 2020) for a course on Competitive Programming, where I got to grow in terms of algorithm knowledge (graph algorithms, binary searches, dynamic programming, segment trees, etc..)
However, the code of most of those solutions is sloppy.

I've added a comment to each file to link the related problem.
