This is just a handful of some problems I solved back in 2019 (and january 2020) for a course on Competitive Programming, where I got to grow in terms of algorithm knowledge (graph algorithms, binary searches, dynamic programming, segment trees, etc..).

However, the code of most of those solutions is sloppy, and doesn't show my knowledge on OOP in C++.

I've added a comment to each file to link the related problem.
